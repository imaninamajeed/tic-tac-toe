# Code Explaination

This document explains the code of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in simple terms for those who are not familiar with software engineering.

## Overview

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is built using a technology called React, which helps us create interactive user interfaces. The game is written in a language called TypeScript, which is similar to JavaScript but with some extra features.

## Main Parts of the Code

### Game Component

The `Game` component is like the brain of our game. It keeps track of the game's state (like whose turn it is and the current state of the board) and tells the other parts of the game what to do.

### Board Component

The `Board` component is like the game board you see on the screen. It shows a 3x3 grid of squares. It gets information from the `Game` component about what to display in each square and what to do when a square is clicked.

### Square Component

The `Square` component represents a single square on the game board. It shows either 'X', 'O', or nothing, depending on the current state of the game. When you click on a square, it tells the `Board` component, which then tells the `Game` component.

## How the Game Works

1. **Starting the Game**: When you start the game, the `Game` component sets up the initial state. It creates an empty board and sets the first player to 'X'.

2. **Making a Move**: When you click on a square, the `Square` component sends a message to the `Board` component, which then tells the `Game` component. The `Game` component updates the state to reflect the move (e.g., it puts an 'X' or 'O' in the clicked square) and switches to the next player.

3. **Checking for a Winner**: After each move, the `Game` component checks if there is a winner. It looks at the current state of the board and sees if there are three 'X's or 'O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If there is a winner, it announces the winner. If the board is full and there is no winner, it announces a draw.

## Styling

The appearance of the game (like colors, sizes, and layout) is controlled by a file called `styles.css`. This file uses a tool called Tailwind CSS to make the game look nice.

## Conclusion

This document provides a simple explanation of how the Tic-Tac-Toe game code works. The main idea is that the `Game` component controls everything, the `Board` component displays the game board, and the `Square` component represents each square on the board. When you click on a square, the components work together to update the game state and check for a winner.
